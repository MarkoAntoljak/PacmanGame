## About The Project

This is my first game project made with Java. I used JavaFX as a framework for building GUI application that runs server on localhost and allows the player to play a game and chat with other people connected to the same server.

## Classes
There are 7 classes that represent objects that are used in the main class. 

## Methods
Game.java
 - start(Stage _stage) : runs the program and creates GUI window with a specific scene
 - playMusic() : used for playing background music
